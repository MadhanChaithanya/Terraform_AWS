Challanges of existing infrastructure:
--------------------------------------
-> Imperative
    -> Document
    -> step-by-step
-> Scalability
-> Mutable Infra    
    - History
    - Incremental
-> Cloud Agnostic

What is Terraform?
------------------
- Terraform is an IT infrastructure automation tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently
- Terraform can manage existing as well as custom in-house solutions
- It turns your infrastructure as code IAC i.e, your computing environment has some of the same attributes as your application:
    - your infrastructure is versionable.
    - your infrastructure is reusable.
    - your infrastructure is testable.
    - Minimizes errors and security violations
- you only need to tell what the desired state should be, not how to achieve it
- Terraform is cloud-agnostic (Not Fully Agnostic).
